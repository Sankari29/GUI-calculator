# GUI-calculator
This Python code implements a simple GUI calculator using the Tkinter library. It features an input field for displaying calculations and buttons for digits (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), and functionalities like clear and equals. 

When users click buttons, the `btn_click` function updates the displayed expression. The `bt_clear` function resets the input, while `bt_equal` evaluates the expression using Python's `eval` function and shows the result. The calculator is structured with a grid layout, providing an intuitive user experience. Overall, it effectively showcases how to create a basic calculator application in Python.
